	  &quot;During the Civil War Goshen furnished 24 men in
	  excess of its quota of 122. In 1861 the population of
	  Goshen was thirteen-hundred, which meant that one out of
	  every nine persons-man, woman and child-was a soldier. Again, not all were patriotic.&quot; &quot;On June
	  23, 1861, a rebel flag was said to be flying at a residence
	  on East Street.  After some earnest persuasion the flag was
	  taken down. Thereupon, a committee was sent to the
	  legislature to push through a law making the raising of a
	  secessionist flag a criminal offense in the state of
	  Connecticut.&quot;

	<p><i>From: GOSHEN CONNECTICUT a town above all others</i><br>
	<p style="font-size: 18pt; text-align: left; padding: 2em; margin: 0 2rem;">Goshen is a much divided town these days.
Over half of Goshenites voted to retain the former president as their
leader.  Some continue to display the signs, flags and paraphernalia
in support of him.  They are our neighbors, friends, relatives who
live and serve in our community.  While we can not support their ideas
of sedition and lawlessness, we have to find a way to reach out to
them.  Why are they so willing to disregard our Constitution, and to
deny truth?  Our goal is to try to find common ground on the things we
agree on to move Goshen to a more prosperous future while retaining
our rural look.  It is also to continue our great history to be the
leaders in keeping our Democratic Republic a transparent, open
government supporting the ideals of Liberty, Freedom and equal justice
under the law.<br>
