    <H1 style="font-size: 32pt;"><b>To All Registered Democrats and Unaffiliated Voters;</b></h1><br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;" />Election Day, November 2, 2021 is quickly approaching.<br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;" />This year we will be electing Goshenites to fill open seats in our Town Government.
    Positions such as 1st Selectman, Selectmen (persons), Planning and Zoning Commissioners, Board of Finance Commissioners, as well as other offices will be voted on.
    We are calling on Democrats and Unaffiliates to join together to lead Goshen into the future with open, honest government.
    As it has been said "all politics is local", and the decisions that will be made by our newly-elected Town government will impact our everyday lives for many years to come.
    <br><br>The challenges of developing responsible, sustainable plans for our Town's future while preserving our rural character can only be successfully met if capable,
    dedicated people step forward to meet them. As we have seenon a national level, leaving critical decisions to a small group playing inside politics and serving only
    their own self-interests, can only result in failure.
    <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;" />The Goshen Democratic Town Committee is looking for people who are interested in town government to run for
    these open positions. We would like to support as many new candidates as possible, and welcome Democrats and Unaffiliates to step forward.
    We need you to help our town succeed.
    <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;" />If you are interested in running, or would like more information, please contact the
    Goshen Democratic Town Committee at <a href="mailto: gdtc06756@outlook.com">gdtc06756@outlook.com</a> or <br><br>GDTC, Post Office Box 173,<br> Goshen, CT 06756<br><br>
    Join us in helping to improve Goshen.<br><br>

      &quot;During the Civil War Goshen furnished 24 men in
      excess of its quota of 122. In 1861 the population of
      Goshen was thirteen-hundred, which meant that one out of
      every nine persons-man, woman and child-was a soldier. Again, not all were patriotic.&quot; &quot;On June
      23, 1861, a rebel flag was said to be flying at a residence
      on East Street.  After some earnest persuasion the flag was
      taken down. Thereupon, a committee was sent to the
      legislature to push through a law making the raising of a
      secessionist flag a criminal offense in the state of
      Connecticut.&quot;

    <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;" />Goshen is a much divided town these days.
	  Over half of Goshenites voted to retain the former president as their leader. Some continue to display the signs, flags and paraphernalia
	  in support of him. They are our neighbors, friends, relatives who live and serve in our community. While we can not support their ideas
	  of sedition and lawlessness, we have to find a way to reach out to them. Why are they so willing to disregard our Constitution, and to
	  deny truth?  Our goal is to try to find common ground on the things we agree on to move Goshen to a more prosperous future while retaining
	  our rural look.  It is also to continue our great history to be the leaders in keeping our Democratic Republic a transparent, open government supporting the ideals of Liberty, Freedom and equal justice
	  under the law.<br>
