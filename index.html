<!-- May 3, 2021:Election Day, November 2, 2021 is quickly approaching.  This year we will be electing Goshenites to fill open seats in our Town Government.  Positions such as 1st Selectman, Selectmen (persons), Planning and Zoning Commissioners, Board of Finance Commissioners, as well as other offices will be voted on.  We are calling on Democrats and Unaffiliates to join together to lead Goshen into the future with open, honest government. As it has been said “all politics is local”, and the decisions that will be made by our newly-elected Town government will impact our everyday lives for many years to come. The challenges of developing responsible, sustainable plans for our Town’s future while preserving our rural character can only be successfully met if capable, dedicated people step forward to meet them. As we have seenon a national level, leaving critical decisions to a small group playing inside politics and serving only their own self-interests, can only result in failure.The Goshen Democratic Town Committee is looking for people who are interested in town government to run for these open positions.  We would like to support as many new candidates as possible, and welcome Democrats and Unaffiliates to step forward.  We need you to help our town succeed.  If you are interested in running, or would like more information, please contact the Goshen Democratic Town Committee at GDTC06756@outlook.com or GDTC, Post Office Box 173, Goshen, CT 06756.                            Join us in helping to improve Goshen.Leslie Goldman, MDChairman. GDTC Nominating Committee -->
