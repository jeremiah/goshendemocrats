      <p><br>I have been an avid reader since childhood and have spent
	many hours studying in public libraries.  Therefor, I know the
	importance of maintaining a strong, well-staffed, and welcoming
	library for all of Goshen’s residents.  As a member of the
	library board, I will work to carry out this important mission.

	  Cushman</a> on my Mother's side and a fourth generation
	resident of Northwest Connecticut. My daughter goes to the same
	school her Grandfather went to. Much has changed since my
	father's days and much will change again. Keeping Goshen,
	Connecticut, and our Republic democratic and free are my only
	political aims and my goal on the Planning and Zoning board
	would be to ensure fair representation of Goshen citizens and
	preserving Goshen's rural character.

      <p><br>I am a Goshen native who in 2002, after a seventeen year stay
	in Boston, returned with my wife to my childhood home to farm and make
	Goshen our home. I became involved in local politics out of a desire
	to serve and to carry on the tradition of community involvement and
	volunteerism which are hallmarks of this great town.</p>
      <p>I have served as a Selectman for eight years, and before
	that on the Board of Finance as well as many civic groups and
	organizations throughout my life here in Goshen.  It is my hope to
	continue to encourage greater community involvement through
	participation in the many groups and civic organizations as well as
	local government.</p><p> We are better when we work together.

      <p><br>I have been an attorney since 1984, and have practiced
	law with my wife, Attorney Rosemary Lane, since 1987. Our main office
	is in Waterbury, but we have a home office in Goshen. We just
	celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary.  Our family moved to Goshen
	in 1998, and our three sons (Bill, Jr.; Dan; John) all attended Goshen
	Center School.  I have previously served on the Goshen Board of
	Selectmen (as a Selectman; not as First Selectman) as well as on the
	Planning and Zoning Commission.  I currently am a member of the Board
	of Finance, as well as of the Board of Fire Commissioners, of which I
	have been the Chairman for the past three years. Also, I have been a
	Constable for many years.
